Upregulation of GPX4 or downregulation of miR-744-5p/miR-615-3p attenuated the inhibitory effect of propofol on CR to Cis. In vivo, propofol inhibited tumor growth and CR to Cis by upregulating miR-744-5p/miR-615-3p and inhibiting GPX4 to induce ferroptosis.

Transferrin (TF) was identified as a target gene of miR-545. To determine whether miR-545 suppresses ferroptosis via TF, we overexpressed TF in HT-29 and HCT-116 cells.

Moreover, we found that GMDS-AS1 and LINC01128 sensitized LUAD cells to CDDP/PEM by sponging miR-6077.

Correlation analysis suggested that the ceRNAs had co-expression relationships, and were associated with blood cell counts. We further explored the role of ceRNA in vitro, and discovered that 1,4- benzoquinone (1,4-BQ) stimulated ferroptosis in AHH-1 cells by inhibiting the expression of GPX4 and SLC7A11, which was partially relieved by knockdown of Lnc-TC and CUL4B. Finally, by interfering with Lnc-TC and miR-142-5p expression, we confirmed that Lnc-TC acted as a microRNA sponge to reduce the accessibility and inhibition of miR-142-5p to CUL4B, thus increasing the expression of CUL4B."

Upregulation of miR-424-5p suppressed ACSL4 by directly binding to its 3'-UTR, which subsequently reduced erastin- and RSL3-induced ferroptosis. Meanwhile, knockdown of miR-424-5p increased the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to erastin and RSL3. Furthermore, ACSL4 was upregulated in ovarian cancer tissues, and high ACSL4 expression predicted worse prognosis and sensitized ovarian cancer cells to erastin- and RSL3-induced ferroptosis. Importantly, decreases in lipid peroxides and ferroptotic cell death mediated by miR-424-5p could be abrogated by ACSL4 overexpression."

Furthermore, under decreased CBS levels, the methylation of the ACSL4 protein was reduced, leading to protein polyubiquitination and degradation of ACSL4.

We also conducted in vitro and in vivo assays examining the function and mechanism of lnc-LBCSs. Knockdown of circSnx12 rendered cisplatin-resistant OC cells more sensitive to cisplatin in vitro and in vivo by activating ferroptosis, which was at least partially abolished by downregulation of miR-194-5p. Molecular mechanics studies indicate that circSnx12 can be a molecular sponge of miR-194-5p, which targets SLC7A11. According to our findings, circSnx12 ameliorates cisplatin resistance by blocking ferroptosis via a miR-194-5p/SLC7A11 pathway.

Importantly, blocking miR-497-5p abrogated the effects of MEG8 loss on cell viability, MDA level and expression levels of NOTCH2, SLC7A11 and GPX4 in HemECs.

Ferroptosis,PSEN1,presenilin 1,ENSG00000080815.20,protein_coding,34903141,"circ-PSEN1 was upregulated in HG-treated ARPE19 cells and showed high resistance to RNase R and Act D. Inhibition of circ-PSEN1 in ARPE19 cells ameliorated the ferroptosis induced by HG was ameliorated, as evidenced by changes in the ferroptosis-related biomarkers/genes and decreased cell death. Subsequently, circ-PSEN1 acted as a sponge for miR-200b-3p. Inhibition of miR-200b-3p partially reversed the effects of circ-PSEN1 on ferroptosis. Furthermore, cofilin-2 (CFL2) was the target gene of miR-200b-3p, and it abrogated the inhibitory effect of miR-200b-3p on ferroptosis. Taken together, the findings indicate that knockdown of circ-PSEN1 can mitigate ferroptosis of ARPE19 cells induced by HG via the miR-200b-3p/CFL2 axis."

The circRHOT1 knockdown notably increased the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), iron, and Fe2+ in breast cancer cells. Mechanically, circRHOT1 was able to sponge microRNA-106a-5p (miR-106a-5p) and inhibited ferroptosis by down-regulating miR-106a-5p in breast cancer cells. Besides, miR-106a-5p induced ferroptosis by targeting signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in the system. Moreover, the overexpression of STAT3 and miR-106a-5p inhibitor could reverse circRHOT1 knockdown-mediated breast cancer progression."
