Collection of analysis scripts and notebooks related to regulated cell death

The analyses and results can be viewed at https://bioinfodlsu.com/regulated-cell-death-playground/

## ðŸ§ª Reproducing Our Results

### A. Read Mapping and Quantification

#### Requirements

- **Operating system:** Linux or Windows (using [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install))
- **Notes:**
  - Our scripts for read mapping and quantification are written in Bash.
  - Use `bash` (not `sh`) to run the scripts since we used some Bash-specific syntax for some of the scripts

#### Setting up Dependencies

### B. Downstream Analysis

#### Requirements

- **Operating system:** Linux, Windows, or macOS
- **Notes:**
  - Our downstream analysis scripts are written in Python and R. We have tested our scripts on Python 3.12 and R 4.4.1.

#### Setting up Dependencies

1. Set up the R dependencies:

   - Most IDEs, such as [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), will automatically prompt you to install the required dependencies when you open a notebook. These dependencies are typically downloaded via [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).
   - However, some bioinformatics-specific dependencies are not available at CRAN and have to be downloaded via [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/). To download them in one go, run `install-dependencies.r`

1. Set up the Python dependencies:
