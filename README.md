# Regulated Cell Death Playground

![badge][badge-r]
![badge][badge-python]

Collection of analysis scripts and notebooks related to regulated cell death

**The analyses and results can be viewed at https://bioinfodlsu.com/regulated-cell-death-playground/**

## üß™ Reproducing our results

**Operating system:** Linux, Windows, or macOS

### Cloning our repository

1. Clone this repository by running:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/bioinfodlsu/regulated-cell-death-playground
   ```
<details>
   <summary>Click to show/hide note for Windows users</summary> <br>
   We recommend Windows users to avoid placing the cloned repository inside a deeply nested folder. The reason is that some scripts/notebooks (e.g., for the analysis of data from The Cancer Genome Atlas) require writing and reading files with long filenames. However, dealing with Windows' 260-character path length limit can be quite tricky: https://blog.r-project.org/2023/03/07/path-length-limit-on-windows/

### Downloading our dataset

1. Download our dataset from this [link](), and place it at the root of the cloned repository.

   <details>
      <summary>Click to show/hide instructions for verifying the integrity of the downloaded dataset</summary> <br>
      If you want to verify the integrity of the downloaded dataset, compute the SHA-512 checksum of the downloaded zipped folder using a hashing utility like `certutil` in Windows, `shasum` in Mac, or `sha512sum` in Linux. You should obtain the following checksum: <br> <br>
      <pre>checksum!</pre>
   </details>

1. Extract the contents of the downloaded zipped folder. The extraction process should result in a folder named `data`, and inside it should be two folders: `patient` and `public`.

   <details>
      <summary>Click here to show/hide the expected folder structure</summary> <br>
      
      - `regulated-cell-death-playground` (root)
        - `data`
          - `patient`
          - `public`
        - `analysis`
        - ...
   </details>

**Note:** If you prefer to run the entire pipeline for generating our dataset (instead of simply downloading it), refer to this [section](https://github.com/bioinfodlsu/regulated-cell-death-playground?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-running-our-dataset-generation-pipeline).

### Running our analysis scripts and notebooks

1. Our analysis scripts and notebooks are written in R and found inside the `analysis` folder. Refer to this [page](https://bioinfodlsu.com/regulated-cell-death-playground/) for a description of each script/notebook.

1. To set up the dependencies, run [`dependencies/install-dependencies.r`](https://github.com/bioinfodlsu/regulated-cell-death-playground/blob/main/dependencies/install-dependencies.r).

**Note:** We tested our code on R 4.4.1 and Bioconductor 3.19.

## üñáÔ∏è Running our dataset generation pipeline

**Operating system:** Linux or Windows (using [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install))

1. Install the package manager Conda. We recommend installing [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/install/).
1. Install the workflow management system [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) by running:

   ```
   conda create -c conda-forge -c bioconda -n snakemake snakemake
   ```
