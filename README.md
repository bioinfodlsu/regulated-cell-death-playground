# Regulated Cell Death Playground

Collection of analysis scripts and notebooks related to regulated cell death

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

Visit [https://bioinfodlsu.com/regulated-cell-death-playground/](https://bioinfodlsu.com/regulated-cell-death-playground/) for a description of the analysis notebooks.

If you want to replicate the analyses:
1. Install R.
2. Most IDEs like [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) will automatically prompt you to install the required dependencies when you open a notebook.
   These dependencies are typically downloaded via CRAN. 
3. However, some bioinformatics-specific dependencies are not available at CRAN and have to be downloaded using Bioconductor.
   To download these bioinformatics-specific dependencies in one go, run `install-dependencies.r`
