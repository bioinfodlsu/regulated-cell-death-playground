Pyroptosis,GSDMC,gasdermin C,ENSG00000147697.9,protein_coding,32929201,GSDMC mediates tumour necrosis following caspase-8 activation in tumour cells and provides valuable insights into the pyroptosis pathway in cancer cells in which the specific expression and distinct caspase-induced cleavage of a gasdermin family member could trigger pyroptosis.
Pyroptosis,ELANE,"elastase, neutrophil expressed",ENSG00000197561.7,protein_coding,29539421,"ELANE is an important protease, which is shown in this paper to promote cell death by cleaving Gasdermin D  in neutrophils. This type of cell death is achieved through a mechanism called pyroptosis which is a defense mechanism of the body against infection, effectively clearing bacteria injected into cells. "
Pyroptosis,IRF1,interferon regulatory factor 1,ENSG00000125347.15,protein_coding,36384204,"IRF1 is shown to be involved in pyroptosis by promoting NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated endothelial cell pyroptosis and the development of atherosclerosis. IRF1 enhances the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome via its transcriptional activity, which leads to the activation of antigen transport protein 1 and the acceleration of Gasdermin D cleavage mediated by the Cascade factor. Additionally, IRF1 promotes Caspase-1-mediated GSDMD activation and cytokine IL-1¦Â release via its transcriptional activity. These two factors constitute the key elements for IRF1's promotion of both noninflammatory apoptosis. and inflammatory pyroptosis. Enhanced expression of IRF1 may lead to endothelial cell death, thereby further inducing atherosclerosis. "

Pyroptosis,CASP3,caspase 3,ENSG00000164305.20,protein_coding,34656686,CASP3 participates in pyroptosis by cleaving the NT domain of the GSDME protein to promote inflammasome-related lytic cell death.
Pyroptosis,GSDMB,gasdermin B,ENSG00000073605.19,protein_coding,35021065,"The study found that GSDMB expression is upregulated in IBD patients, particularly in inflamed colonocytes/crypt top colonocytes. However, cell analysis did not find GSDMB-dependent inflammatory cell death suggesting a potential function in cell proliferation, migration, and cell adhesion. "
Pyroptosis,GZMB,granzyme B,ENSG00000100453.14,protein_coding,32188940,"When NK cells or CD8+ T cells release GZMB, it cleaves GSDME and triggers Pyroptosis.

Pyroptosis,NOD2,nucleotide binding oligomerization domain containing 2,ENSG00000167207.15,protein_coding,32432055,"NOD2 is related to pyroptosis. The experiment used NOD2 inhibitors and VSIG4-siRNA as intervention methods, and found that NOD2 can negatively regulate VSIG4 and positively regulate NLRP3, while VSIG4 has a slight effect on NOD2 and down-regulates NLRP3.

Pyroptosis,TIRAP,TIR domain containing adaptor protein,ENSG00000150455.15,protein_coding,35089323,"Pyroptosis may only be a side effect of BMF rather than its cause. Although the expression of TIRAP leads to increased Caspase-1 levels, indicating the activation of Pyroptosis, inhibiting Caspase-1 is not enough to reverse TIRAP-induced blood cell decrease. This suggests that in this model, Pyroptosis may only be an incidental phenomenon of BMF rather than its cause."

Upon activation, GSDMD forms plasma membrane pores, leading to IL-1¦Â secretion and pyroptotic cell death. IRF2 deficiency resulted in attenuated GSDMD expression, reduced IL-1¦Â secretion, and inhibited pyroptosis in macrophages, endothelial cells, and multiple tissues."

Cells in cochlea lacking PJVK have peroxisomal dysfunction and impaired antioxidant defenses, which contribute to susceptibilities to noise-induced oxidative stress in mice . Two proteins have been found to bind the C-terminal region of PJVK: the actin cytoskeleton regulator, Rho-associated coiled-coil containing pro-tein kinase 2 (ROCK2), and the scaffold protein, IQGAP1. ROCK2 is required to stabilize the actin cytoskeleton by modulating a wide range of substrates, such as myosin light chain (MLC) and LIM kinases . PJVK binds to the coiled-coil domain of ROCK2 and further recruits substrates of ROCK2 . IQGAP1 is known to recruit signaling components to moldulate the actin cyto-skeleton . "

Pyroptosis,PLCG1,phospholipase C gamma 1,ENSG00000124181.15,protein_coding,29937272,"PLCG1 is an important step in phospholipid peroxidation-induced Gasdermin D (GSDMD)-mediated pyroptosis. PLCG1 is a crucial signaling molecule in inflammatory response, and its activation triggers the hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids and the generation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate. In GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis, the production of phospholipid peroxidation can activate PLCG1, leading to the N-terminal cleavage and activation of GSDMD. This process may be related to PLCG1's phosphoinositide pathway and calcium elevation."
